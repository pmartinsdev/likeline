# LikeLine - Personal Learning Project

## Description
LikeLine is an engaging and interactive Instagram clone designed for personal use to practice and apply best practices in web development. It is structured as a monorepo using npm workspaces, with dedicated folders for both the backend and frontend components. This comprehensive README will guide you on setting up and running the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v7 or later)
- MongoDB (v4 or later)
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pmartinsdev/likeline.git
cd likeline
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the `packages/backend` and `packages/frontend` folders with the following variables:

**packages/backend/.env**
```
PORT=5000
DATABASE_NAME=<your-mongodb-database-name>
DATABASE_USER=<your-mongodb-username>
DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your-mongodb-password>
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key-for-jwt>
```

**packages/frontend/.env**
```
PORT=3000
API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

## Starting the Project
To start the entire project (backend and frontend together), run the following command:
```bash
npm run start:project
```

To start only the frontend, run:
```bash
npm run start:frontend
```

To start only the backend, run:
```bash
npm run start:backend
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`, and the frontend server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Docker and Docker Compose
LikeLine uses Docker and Docker Compose to provide a seamless setup. Docker Compose manages containers for both the backend and frontend, ensuring a smooth integration.

## New Folder Structure
The updated project structure is as follows:

```
likeline/
  |- packages/
  |    |- backend/
  |    |    |- src/
  |    |    |- package.json
  |    |    |- ...
  |    |
  |    |- frontend/
  |    |    |- public/
  |    |    |- src/
  |    |    |- package.json
  |    |    |- ...
  |
  |- package.json
  |- ...
```

The `packages/backend` folder contains the backend server code, and the `packages/frontend` folder contains the frontend React application.
